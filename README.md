# Multiple Linear Regression on Startup Data

This project is a Python implementation of a multiple linear regression model designed to analyze data related to startups. The script processes the dataset and applies linear regression to draw insights, particularly focusing on how different factors affect the profitability of startups.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saeed-rhimi/multipleLinearRegression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd multipleLinearRegression
   ```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Explain what these tests test and why:
```
The script tests the effectiveness of multiple linear regression on a given dataset. It helps in understanding how different variables like marketing spend, administration costs, etc., affect the overall profit of startups.
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
